# MySmartWatch

An iOS application that is designed to scan heart rate monitors, display heart rate measurement, step count, and allow customizing the settings. 

It is designed based on the Everest smartwatch. The UUIDs for services and characteristics, and value representations probably differ from watch to watch. So you can't use this code with a different type of smartwatch. You may have to change UUID values and data converts.
